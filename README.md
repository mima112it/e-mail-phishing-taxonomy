# E-mail based phishing attack taxonomy

Phishing is "the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers."

We propose an e-mail based phishing attack taxonomy, which includes six phases of the attack. Each phase has at least one criterion for the attack categorization. Each category is described and in some cases have sub-classes to present the full variety of phishing attacks.
